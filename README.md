# Weasel

WebSocket-connected REPL environment for ClojureScript.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/weasel/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/weasel)

## COMPATIBILITY NOTICE

Starting with Weasel `0.6.0-SNAPSHOT`, you will need at least
ClojureScript version `0.0-2814` and Piggieback version `0.1.4`.  You
may want to use Piggieback version `0.1.5` or newer, however, as it
fixes a number of bugs related to the new ClojureScript REPL APIs.

## Why?

Weasel uses WebSockets to communicate between a ClojureScript REPL,
often hosted on nREPL using [piggieback][].

* A WebSocket transport is simple and avoids some of the thornier bugs
  caused by the `CrossPageChannel` transport, which is used in the
  standard ClojureScript browser REPL and Austin. (see:
  [cemerick/austin#17][austin-17], [cemerick/austin#49][austin-47],
  [cemerick/austin#49][austin-49])
* WebSocket APIs are available in unusual JavaScript environments like
  [JavaScriptCore][goby], [QML][qml], [WinJS][winjs], browser
  extensions, Mac OS X Dashboard widgets, and so on, where use of
  `CrossPageChannel` may be unfeasible due to restrictions on or
  unavailability of `<iframe>` elements.  Weasel allows the
  ClojureScript developer to still enjoy the benefits of REPL driven
  development in these exotic domains.

## Usage

Weasel is intended to be used with Chas Emerick's
[piggieback][piggieback] nREPL middleware.  Once you've set that up,
add Weasel as a dependency to `project.clj`:

```clojure
[weasel "0.5.0"]
```

Start up `lein repl` and piggieback the Weasel REPL environment onto
the nREPL session, optionally specifying a port (defaults to 9001) and
an address to bind to (defaults to "127.0.0.1").

```clojure
user> (require 'weasel.repl.websocket)
nil
user> (cemerick.piggieback/cljs-repl
        :repl-env (weasel.repl.websocket/repl-env
                   :ip "0.0.0.0" :port 9001))

<< started Weasel server on ws://0.0.0.0:9001 >>
Type `:cljs/quit` to stop the ClojureScript REPL
nil
```

In your project's ClojureScript source, require the Weasel client
namespace and connect to the REPL.

```clojure
(ns my.cljs.core
  (:require [weasel.repl :as repl]))

(when-not (repl/alive?)
  (repl/connect "ws://localhost:9001"))
```

You may optionally specify the following:
```clojure
:verbose ; boolean, defaults to true
:print ; :repl to print only to the repl,
       ; :console to print only to the console
       ; #{:repl :console} to print to both
       ; or any variadic function to handle printing differently.
       ; defaults to :repl
:on-open, :on-error, :on-close ; fns for handling websocket lifecycle events.
                               ; default for all is nil
```

Connecting with options:
```clojure
(repl/connect "ws://localhost:9001"
   :verbose true
   :print #{:repl :console}
   :on-error #(print "Error! " %))
```

Load the page in your WebSocket-enabled environment (probably a
browser) and start evaluating ClojureScript at the REPL:

```clojure
cljs.user> (= (js/Number. 34) (js/Number. 34))
false
cljs.user> (do (js/alert "Hello world!") 42)
42
```

Note that unless a client is connected to the WebSocket channel,
evaluation will fail:

```clojure
cljs.user> (+ 5 10)
java.io.IOException: No client connected to Websocket
nil
```

Only a single client can be connected to the REPL at once.  Attempting
to connect to an occupied REPL server will throw an exception in the
client.

## Example

An example project is included in the `weasel-example` subdirectory of
this project.
